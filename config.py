# Your "preferred projects list". Work will be split among these projects according to a given percentage (10, 20, 80).
# For example, if you want 80% of your "preferred project crunching time" to go to a particular project, put in 80. These values must add up to 100.
# If you just want to crunch the most profitable projects all the time (default), leave as is. To customize weight for projects, comment out the next line (and un-comment the subsequent lines) and add projects according to format given:
preferred_projects = {}
#preferred_projects={
#    'https://www.sidock.si/sidock/':20,
#    'https://www.project2.com':80,
#}
# percent of resources to dedicate to preferred projects
preferred_projects_percent = 10  # example: 80. This is ignored if preferred_projects has no projects in it. Rest of weight is assigned to most profitable project according to further settings below
# projects on the ignored_projects list will always have their weight set to zero.
ignored_projects = [
    'https://foldingathome.div72.xyz/', 'http://exampleproject.com/project2'
    ]  # leave as is if you have no ignored projects

local_kwh = 0.1542  # your local price of energy per kwh in USD. Default: 0.1542 (US National average). You can find this on your electric bill.
grc_sell_price = None  # the price you intend to sell your mined GRC at. Leave None to use "current price" or put in USD value of 1 GRC. This is used to determine if mining is "profitable" or not
exchange_fee = 0  # amount to factor into "sell price" when determining profitability. For 3% put .03, for 10% put .10 etc. Default is 0
only_BOINC_if_profitable = False  # suspend BOINC completely whenever crunching is not profitable
only_mine_if_profitable = False  # only run non-preferred projects when doing so is profitable. Benchmarking will still occur.
host_power_usage = 70  # estimated wattage of your mining rig at full use. Check your power supply for the maximum it can deliver and use that number if unsure. Default 70
min_profit_per_hour = 0.00  # mining is only "profitable" if it generates greater than this amount of profit in USD. Default: 0.00

control_boinc = True  # Set to True to use this as your BOINC manager and directly manage the BOINC client. You can still use BOINC Manager/boinctui to monitor its progress. Default: False

SKIP_TABLE_UPDATES: bool = False  # If true, don't print table updates. Useful for scripted runs to reduce output.

stop_temp = 75  # Stop crunching is temp > this number, whole numbers only! Default: 75
# Methods of fetching temp data, only use one!
temp_url = None  # URL to fetch temperature data from, Default: None. # Note this will check temperature quite frequently. This is fine for your smart thermostats on a local IP but not great for publicly-accesible data points. Example: 'https://mytempcheck.com'
temp_command = None  # Shell command to run to check temp data. Must use absolute paths ie '/bin/bash /home/user/tempcheck.sh'.
temp_regex = r'\d*'  # Regular expression used to scrape temp from command, URL, or other specified source. This just grabs the first sequence of numbers it finds. Default: r'\d*'. Examples: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/regex-cheatsheet/
temp_sleep_time = 10  # If we should stop crunching due to temp, sleep this many minutes before checking again. Default: 10

lookback_period = 30  # Number of days to look back to calculate credit -> MAG ratios from various projects. You can set this as low as 1 if you want FTM to respond quickly to profitability changes of projects. If you don't have Gridcoin wallet installed/connected, this setting is always 30 and can't be changed. Default: 30
abort_unstarted_tasks = False  # when we start controlling BOINC, should we abort unstarted tasks? Default is False, it's nicer to projects this way.
boinc_data_dir = None  # Example: '/var/lib/boinc-client' or 'C:\\ProgramData\\BOINC\\'. Only needed if in a non-standard location, otherwise None.
gridcoin_data_dir = None  # Example: '/home/user/.GridcoinResearch' or 'C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\GridcoinResearch\\'. Only needed if in a non-standard location, otherwise None
recalculate_stats_interval = 60  # Interval in minutes to re-calculate stats. Default: 60
price_check_interval = 1440  # how often to check GRC price in minutes, minimum delay of 60 minutes between checks. Default is 1440 (24 hrs)
log_level = 'WARNING'  # Options are: 'DEBUG','INFO','WARNING','ERROR','NONE', default is 'WARNING'
max_logfile_size_in_mb = 10  # Default: 10
rolling_weight_window = 60  # Use stats up to x days old for calculating intended weights vs actual crunch time, Default: 60. Note that "benchmarking" is applied to total time, not windowed time. Benchmarking will take 1% of ALL crunching time across ALL time history. This enables you set smaller "windows" and get faster reaction to weight changes without over-doing benchmarking.

# BENCHMARKING SETTINGS:
# Benchmarking is needed to determine profitability of a project. It is strongly suggested you keep these settings as they are, they are sane defaults.
# These defaults insure our mag/hr calculation is within 10% of what the actual answer is, and that accuracy improves over time
# Until a project is considered "benchmarked", it will be crunched regardless of all other settings (such as profitability) unless skip_benchmarking is set to True.
# Skipping benchmarking means we can't determine what are the most profit or mag-efficient projects. You have been warned!
# Benchmarking in total for all projects will take 1% of processing time. So for a whitelist with 10 projects on it, each project will get .01% of processing time.
# Initial benchmarking criteria: If /any/ of these following two benchmarking criteria are met, projects will considered "benchmarked" and things like profitability criteria can start to apply
benchmarking_minimum_wus = 5  # minimum number of WUs to consider a project benchmarked
benchmarking_minimum_time = 10  # minimum wall time in hours for WUs to be run on a project to consider it "benchmarked"
# Additional benchmarking criteria/options
benchmarking_delay_in_days = 160  # if we have not had a WU from a project in this many days, request a batch. This helps prevent the script from getting in a loop where all projects are considered "unprofitable" but no new WUs are ever ordered so script never realizes project has since become profitable due to a change in the project's credit award system or WU application. Anytime BOINC is allowed to crunch, projects will still benchmark at 1% of crunching time total regardless of this setting.
skip_benchmarking = False  # You can use this to skip all benchmarking. Useful if you've already benchmarked on another identical device and determined most profitable project(s)
# these are not fully implemented yet, but would theoretically allow you to control a non-local BOINC client. They may or may not work idk.
boinc_ip = '127.0.0.1'  # defaults to '127.0.0.1' with quotes
